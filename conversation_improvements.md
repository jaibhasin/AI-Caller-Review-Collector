## Example Conversation Flow:

**Before:**
```
AI: "Hello. Feedback on Lifelong Professional Pickleball Set. How experience?"
User: "It's okay I guess"
AI: "Clarify okay. Quality features user experience question."
```

**After:**
```
AI: "Hi! This is Sarah from Lifelong. How are you doing today? I just wanted to check in about the pickleball set you ordered!"
User: "Oh hi! Yeah, it's been pretty good actually."
AI: "That's wonderful to hear! What do you love most about it so far?"
```

The conversation now feels like talking to a real person who cares about your experience!
