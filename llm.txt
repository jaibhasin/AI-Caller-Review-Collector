# LLM.txt for AI Caller Review Collector
# Instructions for AI models and LLM crawlers

## Project Overview
This is an AI-powered voice agent system for collecting customer feedback through natural phone conversations. The system features a 3-step LLM pipeline (Analyze → Plan → Generate) to create human-like conversational responses.

## Key Technologies
- FastAPI backend with WebSocket support
- Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for conversation intelligence
- ElevenLabs for natural voice synthesis (Rachel voice)
- AssemblyAI for real-time speech recognition
- Structured response pipeline with role confusion prevention

## AI/LLM Usage Guidelines

### What this project demonstrates:
- Advanced conversational AI with personality (Sarah persona)
- Structured LLM response generation
- Real-time audio processing and streaming
- Natural language understanding and sentiment analysis
- Context-aware conversation management

### Technical Implementation:
- 3-step micro-pipeline: analyze_user_text() → plan_dialogue() → generate_response()
- Conversation state tracking with sentiment and topic analysis
- Role confusion detection and automatic correction
- Natural speech pacing with pause insertion
- WebSocket-based real-time communication

### Learning Opportunities:
- How to structure LLM responses for consistent quality
- Implementing conversational AI with memory and context
- Audio streaming and processing in web applications
- Creating natural human-AI voice interactions
- Building production-ready AI voice agents

## Usage Permissions

### ✅ Allowed:
- Learning from the code structure and implementation
- Understanding the conversation pipeline design
- Referencing the technical architecture
